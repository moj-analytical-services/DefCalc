<h3><b>Purpose</b></h3>

<p><li>This is a web-based application designed to aid Ministry of Justice (MOJ) colleagues understand and interpret indices, flexibly convert between real and nominal financial values, and discount financial values.</li>
<p><li>This application is designed to:</li>
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">a. Present up-to-date and short-term future projections for a range of indices published by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">b. Inflate financial values to generate an estimate of nominal expenditure, utilising a range of user-input controls.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">c. Deflate financial values to generate an estimate of real expenditure, utilising a range of user-input controls.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">d. Discount financial values, to aid in generating net present costs, published by HM Treasury.
  

<h3><b>Background</b></h3>

<p><li>Inflation is defined as the general increase in prices over time. For example: in 2010 a worker earns £10/hr and in 2011 they earn £10.20/hr. This will be represented as, year-on-year, a 2% rate of (wage) inflation.</li>										
<p><li>Nominal value is the cost of a good/service at the time it is valued. Following the aforementioned example: in 2010, the nominal wage of the worker is £10. In 2011, the nominal wage is £10.20/hr.</li>											
<p><li>Real value is the cost of a good/service, adjusted to exclude the effect of inflation. This allows for comparisons to be performed between time periods.</li>
<p><li>Descriptive example: the nominal wage represents the price that workers are paid 'in cash' for providing their services to firms. If the nominal price of goods and services in the economy rises faster than nominal wages, then real wages have fallen and subsequently nominal wages are able to purchase fewer goods/services than beforehand (i.e. workers are relatively poorer, even though their wages have increased in nominal value).</li>


<h3><b>Period References</b></h3>

<p><li>Calendar Year: reported as a consecutive twelve month period, beginning January 1st until end of December 31st of the same year. Example: 2020 refers to the period from January 1st 2020 up to, and including, December 31st 2020.</li>
<p><li>Financial Year: reported as a consecutive twelve month period, beginning April 1st until end of March 31st of the following year. Example: 2020/21 refers to the period from April 1st 2020 up to, and including, March 31st 2021.</li>
<p><li>Quarterly: differs from financial year quarters. Reported as a consecutive three month period, beginning January 1st, such that:</li>
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">a. Q1 - January 1st until end of March 31st.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">b. Q2 - April 1st until end of June 30th.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">c. Q3 - July 1st until end of September 31st.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">d. Q4 - October 1st until end of December 31st.
    

<h3><b>Indices</b></h3>

<p><li>RPI: Retail Price Index; an old measure of general inflation.</li>
<p><li>RPIX: Retail Price Index, excluding mortgage interest payments.</li>
<p><li>CPI: Consumer Price Index; the main measure of general inflation.</li>
<p><li>Producer Output Prices; measure of inflation for all manufacturing products (excluding duty).</li>
<p><li>Mortgage Interest Payments; measure of inflation for mortgage interest payments.</li>
<p><li>Actual Rents for Housing; measure of inflation constructed using social housing and private rents.</li>
<p><li>Consumer Expenditure Deflator; allows for the effect of consumer-specific inflation to be removed from related financial values (i.e. converting nominal values to real values).</li>
<p><li>GDP deflator; allows for the effect of general inflation to be removed from financial values.</li>
<p><li>AWE: Average Weekly Earnings; the main measure of wage inflation.</li>

<p><li>Notes:</li>
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">a. All indices are UK-specific.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">b. RPI is, as of 2013, no longer recognised as a UK National Statistic. Its use is not encouraged and should expect to be scrutinised.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">c. Historical indices are originally supplied by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). As such, many of the indices' definitions are derived from the ONS.
    <p style = "margin-left: 1em">d. Future projections of indices are produced by the OBR.
