# DefCalc
Data and Analysis tool, designed to provide a central source for commonly used indices.
Enables users to view, download and upload indices; and inflate, deflate and discount financial values.

### Getting Started
This README file will provide developers with an overview of the project works.

### Prerequisites
Developers **MUST** have access to:
* MOJ-Analytical-Services organisation on Github, and the following repositories:
  * DefCalc; _provides the code necessary to run the app_
 
* MOJ Analytical Platform:
  * RStudio
  * Webapp(s):
    * Defcalc
  * Webapp data source(s):
    * alpha-app-defcalc
    
_Knowledge of R & Rshiny is strongly recommended._
    
### Installing
To link the project to RStudio, it is recommended to clone the repositories using their respective SSH keys.

### Key Files
Within the DefCalc repository, the following are key files:
* ui.R; _contains the code for producing the user interface of the app_
* server.R; _contains the bulk of the code for the app. This includes generating all of the table(s), manipulating the data, download functionality etc. It is set out loosely by 'section' such that each tool has its own scope_
* www; _contains several pages used to generate the guidance displayed within the app for users_
* renv.lock; _details all packages/dependencies required for the app to load_


### Updating
The underlying data for this app will require updating with each new OBR inflation forecasts, typically occuring in line with major policy announcements (e.g., Spring Budget)
* Update the inflation data in the S3 webapp bucket alpha-app-defcalc
  * Update DA_inflation_tool_indexation_table_Month_YYYY.xlsx, renaming so it matches the current month
  * In the server.R file, update the botor::s3_read functions under HISTORIC INDEX DATA TABLES section to match the s3 bucket filepath
* Update the weblinks in the server.R file for OBR DATA section to match OBR's latest forecasts

### Deployment
When ready to deploy new releases, newly published releases should adhere to the following versioning formats: https://semver.org/
