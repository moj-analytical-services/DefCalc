# DefCalc
Data and Analysis tool, designed to provide a central source for commonly used indices.
Enables users to view, download and upload indices; and inflate, deflate and discount financial values.

### Getting Started
This README file will provide developers with an overview of the project works.

### Prerequisites
Developers **MUST** have access to:
* MOJ-Analytical-Services organisation on Github, and the following repositories:
  * DefCalc; _provides the code necessary to run the app_
 
* MOJ Analytical Platform:
  * RStudio
  * Webapp(s):
    * Defcalc
  * Webapp data source(s):
    * alpha-app-defcalc
    
_Knowledge of R & Rshiny is strongly recommended._
    
### Installing
To link the project to RStudio, it is recommended to clone the repositories using their respective SSH keys.

### Key Files
Within the DefCalc repository, the following are key files:
* ui.R; _contains the code for producing the user interface of the app_
* server.R; _contains the bulk of the code for the functions of the app_
* renv.lock; _details all packages/dependencies required for the app to load_

**Botor**
* Users/developers will need to install the botor package in order to run the code. This is so that the app can access its own web bucket.
* Guidance on installing can be found here: https://github.com/daroczig/botor


### Updating
The underlying data for this app will require updating with each new OBR inflation forecasts, typically occuring in line with major policy announcements (e.g., Spring Budget)
* Update the inflation data in the S3 webapp bucket alpha-app-defcalc
  * Update DA_inflation_tool_indexation_table_Month_YYYY.xlsx, renaming so it matches the current month
  * In the server.R file, update the _botor::s3_read_ functions under _HISTORIC INDEX DATA TABLES_ section to match the s3 bucket filepath
* Update the weblinks in the server.R file for _OBR DATA_ section to match OBR's latest forecasts
* Update version number on _HOMEPAGE_

**Future Updates**
* Switch excel tool to xlsm version (already in www/ folder) - this will require different package to "officer" and changes to the code. Will also need to update the guidance
* Upload all presentations and supporting documents (including excel tool) into the s3 bucket and change code in the server.R file to read them in from s3 

### Deployment
When ready to deploy new releases, newly published releases should adhere to the following versioning formats: https://semver.org/
